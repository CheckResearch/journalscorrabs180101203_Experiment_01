## Experiment Setup

### Experiment Content

The experiment consists of executing and reproducing different concepts for conducting spectre attacks that have beed described in the paper. Especially variant1 of spectre attack has been described and tested in detail with the help of simple attacks written in C and JavaScript.
Also a little PoC for exploiting indirect branches has been testet on several systems.

## Experiment Steps

How the experiment has been performed is described in the attached paper in the result folder. 

## Results

Basically it can be said that I was able to understand and reproduce the main concepts that has been described in the paper on differnt systems using Intel processors. More details about the results can be found in the result folder
